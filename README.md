# sh-kvm
JNLP launcher alternative to access the APC KVM in SH server housing.

Tested on Windows 7 32bit, Java 6 have to be supplied separately (SE 1.6.0_45 works for me). Improvements welcomed:)

## How-to
1) unpack to your favorite location
2) unpack Java 6 to the java6 folder
3) login to KVM web as usual, download the JNLP file and open it with kvm.cmd
4) enjoy :)
